# Patient-Positioning-Software
The developed system combines facial recognition, anatomical point tracking, and full-body pose estimation to ensure accurate and reproducible patient setup.
By utilizing MediaPipe's machine learning models, the system can track 468 facial landmarks and 33 body pose points in real-time, providing immediate feedback on position deviations from the reference setup.
The system features automatic patient recognition, which loads historical positioning data and continues tracking in the same log file, enabling consistent documentation across treatment sessions. 
The implementation includes three tracking modes: facial landmark tracking, body pose tracking, and combined tracking, allowing medical personnel to focus on specific anatomical regions during patient setup.
